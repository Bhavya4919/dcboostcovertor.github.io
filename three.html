        A three-phase interleaved DC boost converter is a power electronic circuit that is designed to convert a lower DC voltage into a higher DC voltage with the help of three-phase interleaved technique. It is a type of DC-DC converter that can step-up a low DC voltage into a high DC voltage by interleaving the three-phase input. In this converter, three-phase AC voltage is rectified and then converted into a high DC voltage by using an interleaved converter. The interleaved converter is made up of several parallel-connected modules, each with its own inductor, capacitor, and switch. By interleaving the switching of these modules, the ripple current in the output capacitor is significantly reduced, which results in better efficiency and smaller output filter requirements. The advantages of the three-phase interleaved DC boost converter are its high efficiency, low ripple current, and reduced output voltage ripple. Additionally, it can handle high power levels, making it a suitable choice for industrial applications. Some of the applications of three-phase interleaved DC boost converter include solar power systems, wind power systems, and electric vehicles.
