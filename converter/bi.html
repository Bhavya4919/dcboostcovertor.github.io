        A conventional converter can manage the power flow in one direction
        only. But the power converter which can manage the power flow in both
        directions is the Bi-directional converter. Bidirectional dc-dc
        converters are devices for the purpose of step-up or step-down voltage
        levels with the capability of flow power in either a forward direction
        or in a backward direction. Bidirectional dc-dc converters work as
        regulators of power flow of the DC bus voltage in both directions. In
        the power generation by windmills and solar power systems, output
        fluctuates because of the changing environmental condition. These energy
        systems are not reliable to feed the power as a standalone system
        because of the large fluctuations in output and hence these energy
        system systems are always connected to energy storage devices such as
        batteries and supercapacitors. These energy storage devices store the
        surplus energy during low load demand and provide backup in case of
        system failure and when the output of the energy system changes due to
        weather conditions. Thus, bidirectional dc-dc converters are needed to
        allow power flow in both forward and backward directions. A conventional
        dc-dc converter can be converted into a bidirectional converter using a
        bidirectional switch by using a diode in anti-parallel with MOSFET or
        IGBT allowing current flow in both directions using controlled
        switchingÂ operation.
